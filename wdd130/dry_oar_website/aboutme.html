        Hello everyone! My name is Emilee Hatch, I tend to go by Emilee but my
        family calls me Em. I am married to a wonderful man, and we have one
        child.

        Currently I am pursuing a degree in Computer Programming. So far I have
        had a taste of JavaScript, Python and HTML. Programming has been
        difficult at times, but I have fallen in love with it. I love that I can
        be creative and solve problems at the same time. There are so many
        things you can do with programming.

        When I am not coding I am drawing, or playing with my family. My main
        hobbies include; digital artwork, physical artwork such as painting. I
        also enjoy reading, going outdoors, and watching movies with my husband.
