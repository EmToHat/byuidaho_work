          <div class="faq-content">
            <p>
              Yes! Absolutely! Water rafting is great for kids of all ages.We
              have found however that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy
              it more overall (and parents especially enjoy it more if their
              children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is
              that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a
              time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any
              age.

              The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in
              the world, and you never know what you might see around any
              corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very
              interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has
              been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at
              all without telling stories...some of which are even true!

              As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed
              element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all
              certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3
              years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns
              and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting
              trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation
              device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a
              great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging
              safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should
              prepare for and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.

              Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater
              rafting!...Let's describe a common day on the river. Arise in the
              soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under
              a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh
              blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and
              prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of
              swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and
              more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5, after setting up
              your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the
              river, or explore around camp while your guides prepare your
              dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled
              salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven
              brownies. After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be
              able to talk your guide into another story or two to send you off
              to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.

          <div class="faq-content">
            <p>
              If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year
              in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is
              usually sufficient.
