      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Hi I’m Emilee, what do you do? I am a computer technology major. My
        studies include computer programming and web design. I love designing
        websites and programs that interact with the users. I am making a
        website to show my skill as a developer and broaden my audience. Unlike
        other developers, I am an illustrator with a flexible schedule, and I
        speak three languages; English, French and Spanish. So, what do you do
        when you need a website created?
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Target Audience - Other developers, employers, clients.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Other developers:</strong> I want to make a portfolio to
        demonstrate to other developers my skill in programming and web
        design/development in order to colaberate on future projects.
        <br />
        <strong>Employers:</strong> My portfolio will show my skill as a
        developer. It will demonstrate my skill in web design as well as
        programming with Javascript and other languages. My hope is to show
        employers that I would be a good person to hire.
        <br />
        <strong>Clients:</strong> A portfolio will be a good way to show future
        clients that I have the skill necessary for them to hire me for the
        project they need done.

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Roboto Mono
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        At first I chose Nunito as my heading font, but I thought I would switch
        my fonts and I liked how it looked better as the header font. I like the
        simplicity and readability of this font.
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Nunito
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Similarly to Roboto Mono, I chose Nunito because the style looked nice
        and wasn't hard to read. At first I put Nunito as the heading font but
        after switching my fonts I really liked how it looked in the paragraph
        rather than the heading.

        Emilee Hatch<br />
        Web designer | Computer Programmer | Illustrator
      </h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Who am I?</strong><br />
        Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Emilee, and I am
        twenty-three years old. I am presently a student of Brigham Young
        University-Idaho learning how to design, code, and create. I am married
        to a wonderful Peruvian man and we have one child.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Things I love...</strong><br />
        I love my family and being a mother and a wife. Family is most important
        to me. I enjoy taking adventures and traveling around the world with
        them. Experiencing new cultures is a great part of traveling the world.
        I have had the opportunity to visit many places such as Mexico, the
        Bahamas, the United States, Canada, France, Spain, and Italy. I love to
        design, code, and illustrate. My favorite movies with great
        illustrations are the films from Studio Ghibli. If you haven’t seen them
        they are a must see. I also love to read novels, currently I am reading
        “Dune” which is a great book and a must read.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Educational Goals</strong><br />
        My first short term goal is to learn from the mistakes that I will make
        as a novice developer in order to become a better developer. My second
        short term goal is to pass my classes to the best of my ability. My
        third short term goal is to create connections with fellow students and
        professors as I learn the skills needed to become a developer. My long
        term goal is to get an internship.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Career Goals</strong><br />
        My short term goal after I graduate from Brigham Young University-Idaho
        is to do freelance work. I hope to do freelance work until I find a job
        with a company. My long term goal is to create a business with my
        husband and handle the online part of the business while he handles the
        other part.

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>What are my Skills?</strong><br />
        My skills include JavaScript, Python, HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What is Python?</strong><br />
        Python is a programming language that can be used for a large variety of
        applications.<br />
        <strong>What is JavaScript?</strong><br />
        JavaScript is a programming language which allows the developer to
        implement complex features on websites. When a web page isn't static;
        such as using animated 2D or 3D graphics, scrolling, etc, you will know
        that it is JavaScript.<br />
        <strong>What is HTML?</strong><br />
        HTML Stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is a markup language
        which we use to give structure and meaning to our web content. We can
        define paragraphs, headings, images, etc.<br />
        <strong>What is CSS?</strong><br />
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language of style rules
        which is applied to our HTML content on our websites.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Language Skills</strong><br />
        I speak three languages; English, French and Spanish. I started learning
        French when I was 12 years old and continued learning it through high
        school. I later lived in the Normandie region of France for eight
        months. It was a great experience. I really love the French people, they
        are great. I am presently learning Spanish because my husband is from
        Peru and I wanted to speak with my in-laws.hich is applied to our HTML
        content on our websites.
